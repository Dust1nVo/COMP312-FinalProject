# COMP312-FinalProject

Mission Statement

Our project aims to develop a lightweight, real-time network traffic analysis tool capable of detecting and alerting on suspicious or potentially malicious behaviors within local and remote environments. Using open-source libraries such as Scapy and Pyshark, we seek to simulate, capture, and analyze network-level vulnerabilities—such as unencrypted credential transmission and ARP spoofing—in order to better understand and demonstrate the importance of secure communications. This project is driven by a commitment to cybersecurity education, responsible experimentation, and the proactive identification of threats in an ethical, controlled, and non-intrusive manner.

Code of Conduct

Ethical Intent Only - 
Our work is strictly for ethical, academic, and research purposes. We will not deploy, distribute, or encourage use of this tool for unauthorized or malicious activity.

Consent-Based Testing - 
All simulations, tests, and network manipulations will be conducted within controlled environments or networks where explicit permission has been granted.

Transparency & Documentation - 
We commit to thoroughly documenting all aspects of the project—technical methods, test cases, and limitations—so our tool is used and interpreted responsibly.

Privacy First - 
We will avoid collecting or storing personally identifiable information (PII). Any captured data will be anonymized or simulated for testing purposes.

Continuous Improvement & Responsibility - 
As our detection logic evolves (e.g., DNS spoofing, malformed packet analysis), we will regularly reassess and improve our methods to remain accurate, transparent, and accountable.

Collaboration and Learning - 
We value open dialogue with peers, mentors, and the broader cybersecurity community. Feedback and shared insights will be embraced to enhance the scope and safety of our work.
