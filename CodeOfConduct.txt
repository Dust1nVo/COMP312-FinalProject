Code of Conduct

Ethical Intent Only - 
Our work is strictly for ethical, academic, and research purposes. We will not deploy, distribute, or encourage use of this tool for unauthorized or malicious activity.

Consent-Based Testing - 
All simulations, tests, and network manipulations will be conducted within controlled environments or networks where explicit permission has been granted.

Transparency & Documentation - 
We commit to thoroughly documenting all aspects of the project—technical methods, test cases, and limitations—so our tool is used and interpreted responsibly.

Privacy First - 
We will avoid collecting or storing personally identifiable information (PII). Any captured data will be anonymized or simulated for testing purposes.

Continuous Improvement & Responsibility - 
As our detection logic evolves (e.g., DNS spoofing, malformed packet analysis), we will regularly reassess and improve our methods to remain accurate, transparent, and accountable.

Collaboration and Learning - 
We value open dialogue with peers, mentors, and the broader cybersecurity community. Feedback and shared insights will be embraced to enhance the scope and safety of our work.
